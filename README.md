Inspired by ‘xfun’, this package contains a collection of functions that
I find useful for other packages I develop.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Vmisc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("venpopov/Vmisc")
```

Or via the R-universe repository:

``` r
install.packages('Vmisc', repos = c('https://popov-lab.r-universe.dev'))
```
